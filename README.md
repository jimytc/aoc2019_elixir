![.github/workflows/test.yml](https://github.com/jimytc/aoc2019_elixir/workflows/.github/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

## What is this project for?

Challenge myself for coding in Elixir and buildling a software.

The project will go with [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

In addition, I'm trying to create the default stacks with this language.
